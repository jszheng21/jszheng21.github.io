# About me

I am a master student of [Chinese Information Processing Center](http://www.icip.org.cn/), Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by Le Sun. 
In September 2022, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree without entrance examination. 
In July 2023, I successfully received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from [School of Software Engineering](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/main.htm) of [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/).

My research interests include Large Language Models, especially the evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge.
